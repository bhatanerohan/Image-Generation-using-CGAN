# Image-Generation-using-CGAN
Developed Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with Tensorflow to generate handwritten letters images, conditioned 
on class labels, involving dataset preparation and integrating class labels into the generator and discriminator models 
Training alternates between teaching the discriminator to identify real versus generated images with class labels, and tuning 
the generator to craft more convincing images, guided by labels 
Model demonstrates capability to produce realistic label-accurate images using conditional GAN
